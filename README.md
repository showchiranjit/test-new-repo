Populating the Grid:

For each row in the grid, the function checks if there are corresponding rows in the result set (rsAct).
Depending on the index and conditions, it sets values in the grid's estimated expense column (intEstCol) and actual expense column (intActCol).
Additional logic handles specific conditions, like whether an item is included, and sets values and formulas in the grid accordingly.
Handling Different Expense Types:

The function has a case structure that handles different types of expense codes (like 20112, 20128, etc.), setting appropriate formulas or static texts based on the expense type.
Exception Handling:

The function includes exception handling to catch any errors during the process and potentially handle them or log them appropriately.
